 * Purpose: Fairly complex Movies Library System For Educational purposes. Demonstrates how to develop complete database powered
 *          Applications that Create and Update data in the database. The system also demonstrates how to create reports from
 *          the database. 
 *          
 * Limitations: The system is currently a standalone. It does not support multiple users. This will be implemented in future
 *              versions. 
 *              The system does not have a payments module. This can be developed upon request. Just sent an email to kr@kazemberodrick.com
 *              The system does not have keep track of the number of movies to check for availability. This can be developed upon request.

 *                                      -Multiple-database support. The Base class BaseDBUtilities will be extended to create
 *                                       classes that will support client-server database engines such as MySQL, MS SQL Server etc.
